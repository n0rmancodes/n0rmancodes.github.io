                this is an archive/catalog of all of the content i have made since i have been on the internet. quality is not guaranteed since i've been online
                since i was 5.
            </p>
            <p>
                unfortunately, a small portion is not public since there is some that directly violates copyright law, but if it is gone off the internet you can 
                <i><a href="../../contact/" class="hoverable">contact me</a></i> if you'd like the file.
            </p>
            <p>
                everything that is currently public in this archive is open to the public to use any way you want to. for more information, see more <i>
                <a href="../../licensing" class="hoverable">here</a>.</i> just don't edit it to make me say anything bad or whatever.
            </p>
            <p>if i recently uploaded it and it's not there, give me a maximum of a week to upload it there.</p>
