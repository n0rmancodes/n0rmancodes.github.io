        <h1>licensing</h1>
        <h2>why you don't need to contact me about it.</h2>
        <p>
            almost all of my code is unlicensed and can be used for any purpose. you <i>do not</i> need to
            contact me to ask to license it. this is because i learned from open-sourced code and tutorials 
            myself and i wouldn't want to restrict my code to the world. that and i hate the current state 
            of copyright law.<br><br>

            my programming projects, editing projects, and anything else <i>(that isn't in the exceptions 
            below)</i> are free for any use whatsoever.
        </p>
        <h2>exceptions</h2>
        <p>
            however, there are some exceptions, this is because of various reasons. like, for this code, i don't want people 
            inpersonating me at all. so below is the full list of projects that are <i>not unlicensed</i>.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/n0rmancodes/n0rmancodes.github.io">this code</a> - you must replace the code to your socials before use</li>
        </ul>
