        <h2>basics</h2>
        <p>
            all of my projects are open to the public domain, with or without credit. you <i>do not</i> need to contact me to ask to license it. this is because i learned 
            from other people's work myself and i wouldn't want to restrict my code to the world. that and i hate the current state of copyright law. it feels immoral to 
            lock off my work to the world.<br><br>

            hence, that's why all of current, past, and future work is (basically) in the public domain.
        </p>
