        <p>
            all of my projects are under <a href="https://unlicense.org/">The Unlicense</a> and can be used for any purpose. 
            you <i>do not</i> need to contact me to ask to license it. this is because i learned from open-sourced code and tutorials 
            myself and i wouldn't want to restrict my code to the world. that and i hate the current state 
            of copyright law.<br><br>

            all of my current, past, and future projects <i>unless stated otherwise</i> projects are under the <a href="https://unlicense.org/">The Unlicense</a><br><br>

            you can read more about it on their website <a href="https://unlicense.org/">unlicense.org</a>
